00:00:20,716 --> 00:00:21,676
>> Good morning.


3
00:00:21,676 --> 00:00:21,976
Welcome to our --


4
00:00:22,156 --> 00:00:23,426
Thank you.


5
00:00:23,426 --> 00:00:23,906
Thank you.


6
00:00:24,456 --> 00:00:25,746
It's great to be here.


7
00:00:25,746 --> 00:00:26,986
Thanks everybody for coming.


8
00:00:27,656 --> 00:00:29,026
Welcome to our session on


9
00:00:29,026 --> 00:00:31,386
inducing Podcast Analytics.


10
00:00:31,906 --> 00:00:33,626
I'm James Boggs I manage the


11
00:00:33,626 --> 00:00:36,376
business team for Apple Podcasts


12
00:00:36,376 --> 00:00:37,386
and Siri Auto Briefs.


13
00:00:37,976 --> 00:00:39,486
And we've got a great session


14
00:00:39,486 --> 00:00:40,096
planned for you today.


15
00:00:40,096 --> 00:00:41,116
First, I'm going to share some


16
00:00:41,116 --> 00:00:43,456
details of our podcast business


17
00:00:43,456 --> 00:00:45,086
over the last year, including


18
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:47,136
some very interesting and


19
00:00:47,136 --> 00:00:48,476
exciting milestones.


20
00:00:48,476 --> 00:00:51,306
Then I'm going to welcome Anne


21
00:00:51,306 --> 00:00:52,776
Wootten from our engineering


22
00:00:52,776 --> 00:00:54,356
team to the stage, and she's


23
00:00:54,356 --> 00:00:55,326
going to take us through some


24
00:00:55,326 --> 00:00:58,966
updates to Podcast app for iOS


25
00:00:59,556 --> 00:01:00,486
12.


26
00:01:00,486 --> 00:01:03,176
After Anne, Alec Reitter will


27
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:05,046
take us through a demo of


28
00:01:05,046 --> 00:01:06,486
Podcast Analytics.


29
00:01:06,716 --> 00:01:10,236
And then, we will finish up with


30
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:12,366
Anne sharing some requirements


31
00:01:12,366 --> 00:01:13,766
and taking a look at resources


32
00:01:13,766 --> 00:01:15,396
available to podcast makers.


33
00:01:16,616 --> 00:01:18,746
First off, an update on our


34
00:01:18,786 --> 00:01:20,106
podcast business.


35
00:01:21,146 --> 00:01:23,676
Well, we're just shy of the 13th


36
00:01:23,716 --> 00:01:25,756
anniversary of the launch of


37
00:01:25,756 --> 00:01:28,026
iTunes 4.9.


38
00:01:28,556 --> 00:01:29,926
That's the moment when we took


39
00:01:30,096 --> 00:01:32,556
podcast mainstream for the first


40
00:01:32,556 --> 00:01:32,876
time.


41
00:01:33,546 --> 00:01:35,646
And podcasts have come a long


42
00:01:35,646 --> 00:01:36,426
way since then.


43
00:01:36,816 --> 00:01:38,936
Our constant catalog has never


44
00:01:38,936 --> 00:01:40,116
been more entertaining,


45
00:01:40,246 --> 00:01:42,076
inspiring and educational.


46
00:01:42,246 --> 00:01:43,746
And we've never reached more


47
00:01:43,746 --> 00:01:46,036
listeners around the world than


48
00:01:46,036 --> 00:01:46,956
we do right now.


49
00:01:47,456 --> 00:01:49,076
We're reaching them with some


50
00:01:49,076 --> 00:01:51,896
great programming like "Sandra"


51
00:01:52,036 --> 00:01:52,706
from Gimlet.


52
00:01:53,866 --> 00:01:56,866
This is a brand-new program from


53
00:01:56,866 --> 00:01:58,266
one of the leading independent


54
00:01:58,266 --> 00:01:59,936
podcast networks out of New


55
00:01:59,936 --> 00:02:00,266
York.


56
00:02:00,786 --> 00:02:02,416
And it stars really big talent


57
00:02:02,576 --> 00:02:04,676
Kristen Wiig, Alia Shawkat and


58
00:02:04,676 --> 00:02:05,276
Ethan Hawke.


59
00:02:05,836 --> 00:02:07,626
It's a really fun, scripted


60
00:02:07,626 --> 00:02:09,256
comedy drama about the inner


61
00:02:09,256 --> 00:02:11,226
workings and quirks of a virtual


62
00:02:11,226 --> 00:02:12,946
assistant.


63
00:02:14,246 --> 00:02:16,876
Los Angeles-based Wondery, is


64
00:02:16,876 --> 00:02:18,446
one of the venture capital


65
00:02:18,446 --> 00:02:20,686
backed network startups working


66
00:02:20,686 --> 00:02:22,016
in podcast today.


67
00:02:22,366 --> 00:02:23,376
And last year, Wondery


68
00:02:23,376 --> 00:02:25,356
collaborated with "The LA Times"


69
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:27,316
to produce the thrilling true


70
00:02:27,316 --> 00:02:29,326
crime story of a charming but


71
00:02:29,806 --> 00:02:32,106
sociopathic con man, Dirty John.


72
00:02:32,846 --> 00:02:34,686
The Hollywood style production


73
00:02:34,686 --> 00:02:36,686
values, powerful investigative


74
00:02:36,686 --> 00:02:39,156
journalism and remarkable


75
00:02:39,276 --> 00:02:40,556
storytelling, which is just


76
00:02:40,646 --> 00:02:41,186
riveting.


77
00:02:41,586 --> 00:02:42,756
It drove this show to the top of


78
00:02:42,756 --> 00:02:44,706
the charts in the US, several


79
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:45,976
other markets around the world.


80
00:02:45,976 --> 00:02:47,456
If you haven't had a chance to


81
00:02:47,456 --> 00:02:48,586
check it out, I recommend it.


82
00:02:48,586 --> 00:02:49,416
It's a great binge.


83
00:02:49,946 --> 00:02:54,096
And of course, podcast fans


84
00:02:54,136 --> 00:02:56,516
everywhere are thrilled and


85
00:02:56,516 --> 00:02:58,986
enjoying "Oprah's Super Soul


86
00:02:58,986 --> 00:02:59,896
Conversations."


87
00:02:59,896 --> 00:03:02,496
This is the audio installment of


88
00:03:02,496 --> 00:03:04,396
the queen of talk's iconic


89
00:03:04,606 --> 00:03:05,956
interview franchise.


90
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:07,596
And we are overjoyed to have


91
00:03:07,596 --> 00:03:08,946
Oprah on Apple Podcast.


92
00:03:10,016 --> 00:03:12,666
These examples are just three of


93
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:16,096
the more than 550,000 shows


94
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,406
available today on Apple


95
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:18,096
Podcasts.


96
00:03:18,696 --> 00:03:20,246
That's quite a bit more content


97
00:03:20,246 --> 00:03:21,476
to listen to than the original


98
00:03:21,476 --> 00:03:23,416
3,000 programs we launched with


99
00:03:23,906 --> 00:03:26,966
back in 2005.


100
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:28,456
We're continually refreshing and


101
00:03:28,456 --> 00:03:29,836
managing our directory.


102
00:03:29,916 --> 00:03:31,846
Automatically retiring shows


103
00:03:31,846 --> 00:03:32,966
which become technically


104
00:03:32,966 --> 00:03:34,666
unavailable, or those that run


105
00:03:34,666 --> 00:03:36,696
afoul of our directory content


106
00:03:36,696 --> 00:03:37,386
guidelines.


107
00:03:37,936 --> 00:03:39,326
Such as those with spammy


108
00:03:39,326 --> 00:03:41,136
content or shows seeking to


109
00:03:41,136 --> 00:03:42,786
manipulate our top charts.


110
00:03:43,406 --> 00:03:43,916
Don't do that.


111
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:44,976
Just, please don't do that.


112
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,856
At the same time as we're


113
00:03:46,856 --> 00:03:48,506
managing the directory, we're


114
00:03:48,506 --> 00:03:50,006
accepting thousands of new


115
00:03:50,006 --> 00:03:51,196
submissions per week.


116
00:03:51,696 --> 00:03:53,286
That way, our catalog is


117
00:03:53,286 --> 00:03:55,236
continually refreshed and our


118
00:03:55,236 --> 00:03:56,546
users around the world can


119
00:03:56,546 --> 00:03:57,976
always find something great to


120
00:03:58,036 --> 00:04:00,046
listen to.


121
00:04:00,386 --> 00:04:03,646
Amongst those more than 550,000


122
00:04:03,676 --> 00:04:06,886
active shows, we have over 18.5


123
00:04:06,946 --> 00:04:08,956
million episodes of content.


124
00:04:08,956 --> 00:04:11,406
That's more than 8 million hours


125
00:04:11,406 --> 00:04:12,066
of programming.


126
00:04:12,066 --> 00:04:13,596
So, you better start listening,


127
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:14,636
you better start binging.


128
00:04:15,196 --> 00:04:18,336
As a reminder Apple Podcasts is


129
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:21,065
available in 155 countries.


130
00:04:21,526 --> 00:04:22,456
That's not only for the


131
00:04:22,456 --> 00:04:24,626
distribution of existing shows,


132
00:04:24,706 --> 00:04:26,076
but for the submission and


133
00:04:26,076 --> 00:04:27,706
acceptance of new programming


134
00:04:27,706 --> 00:04:28,926
from each one of those markets.


135
00:04:30,636 --> 00:04:32,756
The podcast directory serves an


136
00:04:32,756 --> 00:04:34,746
audience in all 155 of those


137
00:04:34,746 --> 00:04:36,756
countries with content in more


138
00:04:36,756 --> 00:04:38,086
than 100 languages.


139
00:04:38,596 --> 00:04:40,176
So, that means if you're a


140
00:04:40,296 --> 00:04:42,436
Korean native speaker, ex-pat


141
00:04:42,636 --> 00:04:44,896
living in Toronto, you can find


142
00:04:44,896 --> 00:04:46,446
some great audio programming


143
00:04:46,446 --> 00:04:47,866
from home right in Apple


144
00:04:47,866 --> 00:04:48,616
Podcasts.


145
00:04:49,026 --> 00:04:50,436
And we're particularly proud of


146
00:04:50,436 --> 00:04:50,636
this.


147
00:04:50,636 --> 00:04:52,256
Particularly proud to have such


148
00:04:52,256 --> 00:04:54,336
a diverse catalog and be one of


149
00:04:54,336 --> 00:04:56,076
the easiest ways to reach a


150
00:04:56,076 --> 00:04:57,676
global audience for audio


151
00:04:57,676 --> 00:04:59,626
programming that there is.


152
00:05:00,856 --> 00:05:03,676
The data from our beta version


153
00:05:03,676 --> 00:05:05,616
of Podcast Analytics shows some


154
00:05:05,616 --> 00:05:07,566
remarkable listener affinity and


155
00:05:07,566 --> 00:05:08,096
engagement.


156
00:05:08,826 --> 00:05:10,926
We looked at several hundred of


157
00:05:10,926 --> 00:05:13,006
our recent top episodes, those


158
00:05:13,006 --> 00:05:14,496
with more than seven days of


159
00:05:14,496 --> 00:05:16,426
playback data, and we found some


160
00:05:16,426 --> 00:05:17,606
really notable average


161
00:05:17,606 --> 00:05:18,226
consumption.


162
00:05:18,876 --> 00:05:20,966
Of courses, data is anonymized


163
00:05:20,966 --> 00:05:22,996
and aggregated and a sample.


164
00:05:23,596 --> 00:05:25,286
So, no personally identifiable


165
00:05:25,286 --> 00:05:26,726
information is included and it's


166
00:05:26,726 --> 00:05:28,606
not a comprehensive statistic,


167
00:05:28,676 --> 00:05:30,146
but interesting nonetheless.


168
00:05:30,706 --> 00:05:32,626
It shows that once an episode is


169
00:05:32,626 --> 00:05:35,436
started, on average about 80% of


170
00:05:35,436 --> 00:05:36,826
that episode content was


171
00:05:36,826 --> 00:05:37,396
consumed.


172
00:05:37,476 --> 00:05:38,836
This is great stuff.


173
00:05:38,836 --> 00:05:40,306
And a real testament to the


174
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:41,956
affinity and engagement the


175
00:05:41,956 --> 00:05:43,526
podcast audience has with this


176
00:05:43,526 --> 00:05:46,276
high-quality content.


177
00:05:46,856 --> 00:05:48,896
Last fall, we successfully


178
00:05:48,896 --> 00:05:50,886
integrated more than 50,000


179
00:05:51,066 --> 00:05:53,226
iTunes U collections into Apple


180
00:05:53,226 --> 00:05:53,926
Podcast.


181
00:05:54,626 --> 00:05:56,196
This is content from some of the


182
00:05:56,196 --> 00:05:57,936
world's best educational


183
00:05:57,936 --> 00:05:59,966
institutions; including


184
00:06:00,186 --> 00:06:02,266
developing iOS 11 apps with


185
00:06:02,266 --> 00:06:03,956
Swift from Stanford's Paul


186
00:06:03,956 --> 00:06:04,376
Hegarty.


187
00:06:05,086 --> 00:06:06,816
Naturally, we're eager for the


188
00:06:06,816 --> 00:06:09,006
new installment of this class


189
00:06:09,006 --> 00:06:10,186
series later this year.


190
00:06:10,856 --> 00:06:12,446
As part of Apple Podcast,


191
00:06:12,686 --> 00:06:14,836
teachers can now leverage the


192
00:06:14,836 --> 00:06:17,016
episode serial ordering support


193
00:06:17,016 --> 00:06:17,966
in podcast app.


194
00:06:18,396 --> 00:06:20,306
They can reach new, broader


195
00:06:20,306 --> 00:06:22,526
audience of life-long learners


196
00:06:22,526 --> 00:06:23,316
around the world.


197
00:06:23,996 --> 00:06:25,296
And they can distribute their


198
00:06:25,296 --> 00:06:28,586
content on tvOS for the first


199
00:06:29,156 --> 00:06:29,306
time.


200
00:06:30,046 --> 00:06:32,296
We're seeing some great use of


201
00:06:32,296 --> 00:06:34,256
modern podcast tags, which we


202
00:06:34,256 --> 00:06:36,576
introduced last year, right here


203
00:06:36,576 --> 00:06:38,336
on stage at WWDC.


204
00:06:39,196 --> 00:06:41,306
Many podcasts includes trailers


205
00:06:41,306 --> 00:06:42,586
to thematically introduce the


206
00:06:42,586 --> 00:06:44,346
feel and sound of their show.


207
00:06:44,866 --> 00:06:46,286
This is the best way really to


208
00:06:46,286 --> 00:06:47,536
launch a new podcast.


209
00:06:47,536 --> 00:06:49,676
And ESPN for example, makes


210
00:06:49,676 --> 00:06:50,616
great use of trailers.


211
00:06:50,886 --> 00:06:52,466
And in addition is amongst the


212
00:06:52,466 --> 00:06:54,786
chart-topping shows that uses


213
00:06:54,786 --> 00:06:56,576
seasons and bonus content.


214
00:06:57,246 --> 00:06:58,786
This allows Jody Avirgan and the


215
00:06:58,786 --> 00:07:00,756
team to easily present the


216
00:07:00,756 --> 00:07:01,976
thematically different


217
00:07:01,976 --> 00:07:03,776
collections of episodes in each


218
00:07:03,776 --> 00:07:04,126
season.


219
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:06,956
In addition to seasons and bonus


220
00:07:06,956 --> 00:07:09,386
content, "30 for 30" feeds their


221
00:07:09,386 --> 00:07:11,756
super fans with bonus episodes.


222
00:07:12,366 --> 00:07:13,596
These complement the full season


223
00:07:13,596 --> 00:07:14,166
episodes.


224
00:07:15,796 --> 00:07:17,556
A best practice regarding bonus


225
00:07:17,556 --> 00:07:18,776
content is to make sure that


226
00:07:18,776 --> 00:07:20,966
your bonus episodes are tagged


227
00:07:20,966 --> 00:07:22,496
appropriately to the full season


228
00:07:22,496 --> 00:07:23,096
episodes.


229
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:24,786
This will ensure proper ordering


230
00:07:24,786 --> 00:07:26,796
of the content in Apple Podcast.


231
00:07:27,546 --> 00:07:28,916
And of course, episode number.


232
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:31,026
We're using this handy reference


233
00:07:31,026 --> 00:07:33,146
for your audience inside podcast


234
00:07:33,146 --> 00:07:33,366
app.


235
00:07:33,776 --> 00:07:35,366
We're also making use of episode


236
00:07:35,366 --> 00:07:36,666
numbers that you provide in the


237
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:39,036
RSS feed in Podcast Analytics.


238
00:07:40,516 --> 00:07:42,926

239
00:07:42,926 --> 00:07:45,166
venture-backed hosting startups


240
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:46,036
have started to grow.


241
00:07:46,496 --> 00:07:48,136
Organizations such as Anchor,


242
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:51,506

243

And Simplecast with brand new

264

265
00:08:34,196 --> 00:08:35,816
Siri has been optimized for


266
00:08:35,816 --> 00:08:36,905

news.


273
00:08:48,216 --> 00:08:49,666
We're proud to be distributing

00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:52,166

business, and even get an update

on the goings-on in music from


284
00:09:09,176 --> 00:09:10,646
our own Apple music team.


285
00:09:12,656 --> 00:09:14,496
We're thrilled to celebrate the


286
00:09:14,496 --> 00:09:16,416
incredible milestone of 50


287
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:18,196
billion episode downloads and


288
00:09:18,196 --> 00:09:20,366
streams on Apple Podcast, since


289
00:09:20,366 --> 00:09:21,336
the launch of the service in


290
00:09:21,336 --> 00:09:22,176
2005.


291
00:09:22,936 --> 00:09:24,826
With over 10.5 billion episode


292
00:09:24,826 --> 00:09:26,456
downloads and streaming plays in


293
00:09:26,456 --> 00:09:30,046
2016, and more than 13.7 billion


294
00:09:30,046 --> 00:09:30,796
last year.


295
00:09:30,796 --> 00:09:32,066
The growth trajectory of the


296
00:09:32,126 --> 00:09:34,116
platform is amazing.


297
00:09:34,686 --> 00:09:37,256
We're also thrilled that the


298
00:09:37,256 --> 00:09:39,456
shows that are driving all this


299
00:09:39,456 --> 00:09:41,156
consumption are of such a high


300
00:09:41,156 --> 00:09:41,816
quality.


301
00:09:42,346 --> 00:09:44,216
And it's a pleasure for us to be


302
00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:45,626
able to champion this content on


303
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:47,206
top of our platform.


304
00:09:47,766 --> 00:09:49,156
We celebrate the podcasts that


305
00:09:49,156 --> 00:09:50,566
contribute to this 50-billion


306
00:09:50,566 --> 00:09:51,896
milestone in one show in


307
00:09:51,896 --> 00:09:53,946
particular, "Stuff You Should


308
00:09:53,946 --> 00:09:55,716
Know" from Atlanta's How Stuff


309
00:09:55,716 --> 00:09:56,456
Works Network.


310
00:09:56,526 --> 00:09:58,866
The first podcast, and Apple


311
00:09:58,866 --> 00:10:01,236
Podcast to exceed 500 million


312
00:10:01,236 --> 00:10:01,976
downloads and streams.


313
00:10:02,546 --> 00:10:04,446
Wow. Congratulations to Chuck,


314
00:10:04,886 --> 00:10:06,046
Josh, Jerry and the rest of the


315
00:10:06,046 --> 00:10:06,466
team.


316
00:10:06,506 --> 00:10:07,056
Well done.


317
00:10:07,056 --> 00:10:08,436
We're looking forward to the


318
00:10:08,436 --> 00:10:10,216
next half-billion downloads and


319
00:10:10,216 --> 00:10:10,666
streams.


320
00:10:12,936 --> 00:10:14,826
So, with that business update,


321
00:10:15,396 --> 00:10:16,966
let me welcome Anne to the stage


322
00:10:16,966 --> 00:10:18,366
to take us through our app.


323
00:10:19,516 --> 00:10:23,606
[ Applause ]


324
00:10:24,106 --> 00:10:26,186
>> Thanks, James.


325
00:10:26,836 --> 00:10:28,626
Thanks, James, and hi.


326
00:10:28,626 --> 00:10:30,196
I'm Anne, and I run Podcasts


327
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:31,076
Engineering at Apple.


328
00:10:31,696 --> 00:10:34,236
Before we dive much deeper into


329
00:10:34,236 --> 00:10:35,536
analytics, I want to highlight a


330
00:10:35,536 --> 00:10:37,066
few of the latest updates to the


331
00:10:37,066 --> 00:10:38,906
podcast app.


332
00:10:39,766 --> 00:10:41,236
As you probably heard in


333
00:10:41,236 --> 00:10:42,516
yesterday's keynote, we are


334
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:43,976
thrilled to be launching


335
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:45,846
podcasts for Apple Watch this


336
00:10:45,846 --> 00:10:46,166
fall.


337
00:10:46,996 --> 00:10:48,966
It was one of the most requested


338
00:10:48,966 --> 00:10:50,986
features for Apple Watch and for


339
00:10:50,986 --> 00:10:51,396
good reason.


340
00:10:52,066 --> 00:10:54,146
Between HomePod and Apple Watch,


341
00:10:54,146 --> 00:10:55,806
listening to podcasts has never


342
00:10:55,806 --> 00:10:58,166
been easier or more hands-free.


343
00:10:59,496 --> 00:11:01,836
We're also really excited to


344
00:11:01,836 --> 00:11:02,996
share that we've enhanced our


345
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:04,366
support for chapters in the


346
00:11:04,366 --> 00:11:05,956
podcast app.


347
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:07,556
In the upcoming iOS release,


348
00:11:07,556 --> 00:11:09,116
we're extending full chapter


349
00:11:09,116 --> 00:11:10,806
support to MP3s.


350
00:11:12,396 --> 00:11:13,486
In addition to enabling


351
00:11:13,486 --> 00:11:15,046
podcasters to segment their


352
00:11:15,106 --> 00:11:17,266
episodes into shorter discrete


353
00:11:17,266 --> 00:11:19,086
chapters, this functionality


354
00:11:19,086 --> 00:11:21,316
also includes chapter art that


355
00:11:21,316 --> 00:11:22,816
displays as the play head


356
00:11:22,816 --> 00:11:24,426
advances across chapters.


357
00:11:24,636 --> 00:11:26,596
So, podcasters can supplement


358
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:28,496
their audio with visual content.


359
00:11:29,036 --> 00:11:32,786
In the upcoming iOS release,


360
00:11:32,786 --> 00:11:34,856
we're also offering an improved


361
00:11:34,856 --> 00:11:35,986
experience for podcast


362
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:36,856
notifications.


363
00:11:37,556 --> 00:11:38,996
The new podcast notifications


364
00:11:38,996 --> 00:11:40,696
are groups across shows and


365
00:11:40,696 --> 00:11:42,406
episodes, into a single


366
00:11:42,406 --> 00:11:43,636
expandable stack.


367
00:11:44,506 --> 00:11:45,916
That reduces clutter on the


368
00:11:45,916 --> 00:11:46,386
screen.


369
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:49,756
And we've also provided one-tap


370
00:11:49,756 --> 00:11:51,876
access to notification settings


371
00:11:51,876 --> 00:11:53,236
for all of your shows.


372
00:11:53,626 --> 00:11:55,116
That means if you only want to


373
00:11:55,116 --> 00:11:56,536
get notifications for your


374
00:11:56,536 --> 00:11:58,576
favorite show, "99% Invisible,"


375
00:11:58,966 --> 00:12:00,616
it's as simple as toggling the


376
00:12:00,616 --> 00:12:02,426
switches on this single settings


377
00:12:02,426 --> 00:12:02,826
page.


378
00:12:03,406 --> 00:12:07,676
So, last year at WWDC, we


379
00:12:07,676 --> 00:12:09,196
announced that Apple would be


380
00:12:09,196 --> 00:12:10,946
launching Podcast Analytics for


381
00:12:10,946 --> 00:12:11,696
the first time.


382
00:12:12,336 --> 00:12:13,856
We were super excited to launch


383
00:12:13,856 --> 00:12:15,166
at the end of 2017.


384
00:12:15,766 --> 00:12:17,116
And Podcast Analytics is


385
00:12:17,116 --> 00:12:19,326
available in beta right now,


386
00:12:19,326 --> 00:12:21,586
today, to anyone with a podcast


387
00:12:21,586 --> 00:12:22,226
in our catalog.


388
00:12:24,096 --> 00:12:26,136
We know that this is a service


389
00:12:26,136 --> 00:12:28,376
that was long desired and speaks


390
00:12:28,376 --> 00:12:29,626
to a critical need in the


391
00:12:29,626 --> 00:12:32,156
industry, as evidenced by work


392
00:12:32,156 --> 00:12:33,756
like the remote audio data speck


393
00:12:33,996 --> 00:12:35,586
being spearheaded by NPR.


394
00:12:36,586 --> 00:12:38,556
So, it's important to us that we


395
00:12:38,556 --> 00:12:40,326
provide this anonymous data back


396
00:12:40,436 --> 00:12:42,076
to publishers to help them


397
00:12:42,456 --> 00:12:44,266
better understand how their


398
00:12:44,266 --> 00:12:45,946
audiences are consuming their


399
00:12:45,946 --> 00:12:46,276
audio.


400
00:12:46,276 --> 00:12:49,156
And all of the data and


401
00:12:49,156 --> 00:12:51,576
analytics is based on the use of


402
00:12:51,576 --> 00:12:53,496
the updated Apple Podcast App


403
00:12:53,836 --> 00:12:57,076
from iOS 11 and iTunes 12.7.


404
00:12:57,676 --> 00:12:59,206
We're collecting data only from


405
00:12:59,206 --> 00:13:00,226
those operating systems,


406
00:13:00,226 --> 00:13:00,736
forward.


407
00:13:01,086 --> 00:13:02,656
And the analytics dashboard


408
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:04,296
includes listening data from


409
00:13:04,296 --> 00:13:06,956
HomePod, AppleTV and will


410
00:13:06,956 --> 00:13:08,466
include Apple Watch listening


411
00:13:08,466 --> 00:13:10,616
data starting in watchOS 5.


412
00:13:11,276 --> 00:13:15,476
As you know, privacy is really


413
00:13:15,476 --> 00:13:17,346
important to Apple and we are


414
00:13:17,346 --> 00:13:19,156
only showing aggregate data of


415
00:13:19,156 --> 00:13:20,736
those users who have agreed to


416
00:13:20,736 --> 00:13:22,996
use the Podcast App.


417
00:13:22,996 --> 00:13:24,226
It is anonymous.


418
00:13:24,646 --> 00:13:26,296
Not personally identifiable.


419
00:13:26,776 --> 00:13:28,956
Not tied to your Apple ID.


420
00:13:28,956 --> 00:13:30,636
And we only reflect data points


421
00:13:30,636 --> 00:13:31,636
in aggregate that we've


422
00:13:31,636 --> 00:13:33,286
collected from at least five


423
00:13:33,346 --> 00:13:34,166
unique devices.


424
00:13:34,816 --> 00:13:37,626
And it couldn't be easier to get


425
00:13:37,626 --> 00:13:37,986
started.


426
00:13:38,156 --> 00:13:39,466
You don't need to write any


427
00:13:39,466 --> 00:13:39,936
code.


428
00:13:39,936 --> 00:13:41,486
You don't need to use an SDK and


429
00:13:41,486 --> 00:13:42,416
it's totally free.


430
00:13:42,416 --> 00:13:44,636
If you have a podcast, all you


431
00:13:44,636 --> 00:13:46,796
have to do is submit your feed


432
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:48,526
to Podcast Connect after you


433
00:13:48,526 --> 00:13:49,176
signed in.


434
00:13:49,516 --> 00:13:51,206
Get it approved, get some


435
00:13:51,206 --> 00:13:53,116
listeners, then check your


436
00:13:53,116 --> 00:13:54,446
performance through the Podcast


437
00:13:54,446 --> 00:13:55,716
Analytics Dashboard.


438
00:13:57,656 --> 00:14:00,276
Analytics reports data from


439
00:14:00,276 --> 00:14:02,366
unique devices that engage with


440
00:14:02,366 --> 00:14:04,926
the Podcast App.


441
00:14:04,926 --> 00:14:06,236
As my colleague Alec is about to


442
00:14:06,236 --> 00:14:07,596
show us from the Analytics


443
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:09,706
Dashboard, publishes can access


444
00:14:09,706 --> 00:14:11,886
an overview that includes tables


445
00:14:11,886 --> 00:14:14,046
and charts with data like unique


446
00:14:14,046 --> 00:14:15,556
device counts for a selected


447
00:14:15,556 --> 00:14:16,496
period of time.


448
00:14:17,046 --> 00:14:18,536
Total time listened.


449
00:14:19,236 --> 00:14:20,586
Time per device.


450
00:14:21,246 --> 00:14:22,326
Average consumption.


451
00:14:22,876 --> 00:14:24,426
Top countries, and more.


452
00:14:26,476 --> 00:14:28,816
So, some of you may be familiar


453
00:14:28,816 --> 00:14:30,306
with our podcast, "The Very


454
00:14:30,306 --> 00:14:31,446
Hungry Tourists."


455
00:14:32,036 --> 00:14:34,336
They're back for season two and


456
00:14:34,336 --> 00:14:35,736
they even have some new cover


457
00:14:36,426 --> 00:14:37,196
art.


458
00:14:37,196 --> 00:14:38,296
Alec is going to take you on a


459
00:14:38,296 --> 00:14:39,656
deeper dive of how to get the


460
00:14:39,656 --> 00:14:42,176
most out of Analytics.


461
00:14:42,276 --> 00:14:43,666
We're excited to continue


462
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:45,196
providing key listening metrics


463
00:14:45,196 --> 00:14:46,636
for this industry and we are


464
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:47,846
listening to your feedback and


465
00:14:48,226 --> 00:14:49,626
continuing to improve the


466
00:14:49,626 --> 00:14:50,096
service.


467
00:14:50,096 --> 00:14:51,176
So, thank you.


468
00:14:51,636 --> 00:14:53,506
And with, that I'm going to hand


469
00:14:53,506 --> 00:14:55,276
it over to Alec to take us on a


470
00:14:55,276 --> 00:14:56,866
tour of Podcast Analytics.


471
00:14:57,516 --> 00:15:03,736
[ Applause ]


472
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:04,866
>> Thank you, Anne.


473
00:15:05,806 --> 00:15:08,216
So, podcasters, every day you're


474
00:15:08,216 --> 00:15:10,846
hard at work making great shows


475
00:15:10,846 --> 00:15:12,416
and episodes for people to enjoy


476
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:13,256
all over the world.


477
00:15:14,296 --> 00:15:15,326
But how much do you know about


478
00:15:15,326 --> 00:15:16,026
your audience?


479
00:15:16,596 --> 00:15:19,276
Do you know how many listeners


480
00:15:19,276 --> 00:15:20,986
you have, or how much they


481
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:21,386
listen?


482
00:15:22,456 --> 00:15:23,356
Do you know where they are


483
00:15:23,356 --> 00:15:24,236
around the world?


484
00:15:25,196 --> 00:15:25,956
What are their favorite


485
00:15:25,956 --> 00:15:26,516
episodes?


486
00:15:27,006 --> 00:15:28,966
With Podcast Analytics, Apple


487
00:15:28,966 --> 00:15:30,936
offers you the transparency into


488
00:15:30,936 --> 00:15:32,096
how you show is heard.


489
00:15:32,836 --> 00:15:34,026
So, you can better understand


490
00:15:34,026 --> 00:15:35,496
your listeners and create the


491
00:15:35,496 --> 00:15:36,766
best show for you audience.


492
00:15:37,886 --> 00:15:39,076
My name is Alec Reitter and I'm


493
00:15:39,076 --> 00:15:40,596
going to do a walkthrough and


494
00:15:40,596 --> 00:15:42,306
demo of Podcast Analytics.


495
00:15:42,956 --> 00:15:44,616
So, let's get started by heading


496
00:15:44,616 --> 00:15:45,606
to the login page.


497
00:15:46,146 --> 00:15:48,946
When you see this bright purple


498
00:15:48,946 --> 00:15:50,316
page, you know you've made it to


499
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:51,056
the right place.


500
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:53,156
Here, we're going to log in with


501
00:15:53,156 --> 00:15:55,006
the Apple ID that we used to


502
00:15:55,006 --> 00:15:56,926
originally submit the podcast


503
00:15:56,926 --> 00:15:59,056
feed to the Apple Podcast


504
00:15:59,056 --> 00:15:59,496
Catalog.


505
00:15:59,796 --> 00:16:02,746
Now, if you have any trouble


506
00:16:02,746 --> 00:16:04,866
such as, you forget your


507
00:16:04,926 --> 00:16:06,696
password for your Apple ID, or


508
00:16:06,696 --> 00:16:07,776
you don't know which Apple ID to


509
00:16:07,856 --> 00:16:10,276
use, or if, after you've logged


510
00:16:10,276 --> 00:16:12,696
in you don't see all the shows


511
00:16:12,696 --> 00:16:15,716
you expect to see, go to the top


512
00:16:15,716 --> 00:16:17,086
right corner of this page and


513
00:16:17,086 --> 00:16:18,196
click on that question mark


514
00:16:18,196 --> 00:16:18,616
icon.


515
00:16:18,756 --> 00:16:20,546
That will take you to resources


516
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:20,946
and help.


517
00:16:21,446 --> 00:16:22,796
And there you can find a contact


518
00:16:22,796 --> 00:16:24,206
us link, where people can give


519
00:16:24,206 --> 00:16:25,256
you the assistance you need.


520
00:16:25,256 --> 00:16:27,896
In this example, we're going to


521
00:16:27,896 --> 00:16:29,846
use John Appleseed's login


522
00:16:29,846 --> 00:16:30,486
credentials.


523
00:16:30,686 --> 00:16:32,636
So, let's log in now and see


524
00:16:32,636 --> 00:16:34,616
what he sees when he enters


525
00:16:34,656 --> 00:16:35,506
Podcast Analytics.


526
00:16:40,196 --> 00:16:43,486
So, this is the shows page.


527
00:16:43,526 --> 00:16:45,466
Here we see five shows for


528
00:16:45,466 --> 00:16:46,146
John's account.


529
00:16:47,286 --> 00:16:50,796
In this table, there are three


530
00:16:50,796 --> 00:16:51,436
metrics.


531
00:16:51,616 --> 00:16:52,526
And we're going to take a look


532
00:16:52,526 --> 00:16:53,366
at those in a minute.


533
00:16:54,206 --> 00:16:55,766
And all of the data in this


534
00:16:55,766 --> 00:16:57,346
table is driven by the date


535
00:16:57,346 --> 00:16:58,556
picker, which is in the top


536
00:16:58,556 --> 00:16:59,106
right corner.


537
00:16:59,466 --> 00:17:00,686
Right now, it's set to the last


538
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,656
60 days and that is the default.


539
00:17:03,466 --> 00:17:05,126
So, let's take a look at the top


540
00:17:05,126 --> 00:17:06,925
row for "The Very Hungry


541
00:17:06,925 --> 00:17:07,566
Tourists."


542
00:17:08,836 --> 00:17:10,606
Here we can see the number of


543
00:17:10,606 --> 00:17:12,356
unique devices for the last 60


544
00:17:12,356 --> 00:17:12,646
days.


545
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:14,986
This answers the question, how


546
00:17:14,986 --> 00:17:16,165
many listeners do I have?


547
00:17:16,685 --> 00:17:19,556
Here we see, 256,000 unique


548
00:17:19,556 --> 00:17:20,195
devices.


549
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:23,016
Next to that, we can answer the


550
00:17:23,016 --> 00:17:24,705
question how much do they


551
00:17:24,705 --> 00:17:25,126
listen.


552
00:17:25,756 --> 00:17:26,996
In this case, the total time


553
00:17:26,996 --> 00:17:31,636
listened is 327,000 total hours.


554
00:17:32,876 --> 00:17:34,626
Now, if we do a little math we


555
00:17:34,626 --> 00:17:36,016
can find the average which is


556
00:17:36,016 --> 00:17:38,256
the time per device of 1 hour


557
00:17:38,256 --> 00:17:39,396
and 17 minutes.


558
00:17:39,686 --> 00:17:41,256
So, this is a very popular show.


559
00:17:41,486 --> 00:17:41,976
It's doing really well.


560
00:17:46,366 --> 00:17:48,466
So, next we're going to switch


561
00:17:48,466 --> 00:17:50,656
tabs from the shows tab to the


562
00:17:50,656 --> 00:17:52,976
episodes tab.


563
00:17:53,176 --> 00:17:54,996
Here we can see a cross-section


564
00:17:55,566 --> 00:17:58,176
of episodes across all of the


565
00:17:58,176 --> 00:17:59,226
shows in John's account.


566
00:18:00,156 --> 00:18:01,556
Here we see a few of the most


567
00:18:01,556 --> 00:18:02,976
recently released episodes.


568
00:18:05,846 --> 00:18:07,096
Now, this data table has a lot


569
00:18:07,096 --> 00:18:08,126
more information in it.


570
00:18:08,126 --> 00:18:10,196
And let's take a look at the top


571
00:18:10,196 --> 00:18:10,606
row.


572
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:13,906
This is the most recent episode


573
00:18:13,906 --> 00:18:15,136
from "The Very Hungry Tourists"


574
00:18:16,096 --> 00:18:18,056
starting on the righthand side


575
00:18:18,056 --> 00:18:20,726
we can see the name of the


576
00:18:21,176 --> 00:18:23,166
episode, then the name of the


577
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:23,606
show.


578
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:26,036
And now, the third column is the


579
00:18:26,036 --> 00:18:26,776
episode column.


580
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:28,426
If you're making use of the new


581
00:18:28,426 --> 00:18:30,546
tags, like season, episode and


582
00:18:30,546 --> 00:18:32,316
episode type, they'll show up


583
00:18:32,316 --> 00:18:32,606
here.


584
00:18:33,776 --> 00:18:34,986
Following that, we have the


585
00:18:34,986 --> 00:18:36,386
release date, and then the


586
00:18:36,386 --> 00:18:37,056
duration.


587
00:18:37,796 --> 00:18:38,756
So, in this case, it's a


588
00:18:38,756 --> 00:18:40,206
35-minute long episode.


589
00:18:40,926 --> 00:18:42,776
If, when you log in, you don't


590
00:18:42,776 --> 00:18:43,886
see the right number in the


591
00:18:43,886 --> 00:18:46,826
duration column, it's because of


592
00:18:46,826 --> 00:18:47,866
what you have in your feed.


593
00:18:48,216 --> 00:18:49,366
We pull this number straight


594
00:18:49,366 --> 00:18:49,966
from your feed.


595
00:18:50,116 --> 00:18:51,596
So, make sure it's accurate.


596
00:18:52,866 --> 00:18:54,766
Following the duration column,


597
00:18:54,766 --> 00:18:56,026
we see three columns that we've


598
00:18:56,026 --> 00:18:57,856
seen before, except this time,


599
00:18:58,306 --> 00:18:59,706
for this episode specifically.


600
00:18:59,996 --> 00:19:01,736
So, we have devices, total time


601
00:19:01,736 --> 00:19:03,296
listened, and time per device.


602
00:19:04,696 --> 00:19:06,646
And for the first time, we see


603
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:07,736
average consumption.


604
00:19:08,016 --> 00:19:09,356
This is the last metric in the


605
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:10,306
far-right column.


606
00:19:11,056 --> 00:19:13,046
Average consumption is really


607
00:19:13,046 --> 00:19:14,426
great because it's really just


608
00:19:14,426 --> 00:19:15,786
another way of looking at time


609
00:19:15,786 --> 00:19:16,556
per device.


610
00:19:17,206 --> 00:19:19,006
So, in this case, it's 28


611
00:19:19,006 --> 00:19:21,056
minutes for this 35-minute long


612
00:19:21,056 --> 00:19:21,576
episode.


613
00:19:22,346 --> 00:19:23,596
That is 81%.


614
00:19:24,016 --> 00:19:25,016
What's nice about average


615
00:19:25,016 --> 00:19:26,736
consumption is it allows us to


616
00:19:26,736 --> 00:19:28,516
compare episodes of differing


617
00:19:28,516 --> 00:19:30,826
durations against each other, to


618
00:19:30,826 --> 00:19:32,186
really get a sense of how


619
00:19:32,186 --> 00:19:33,646
healthy each episode is doing.


620
00:19:34,466 --> 00:19:38,776
Now, from here, let's click


621
00:19:38,776 --> 00:19:40,366
through on the show title and


622
00:19:40,366 --> 00:19:42,086
look at the show overview for


623
00:19:42,086 --> 00:19:43,226
"The Very Hungry Tourists."


624
00:19:45,756 --> 00:19:47,576
So, here's the show overview.


625
00:19:48,186 --> 00:19:50,166
There's a lot going on here.


626
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:51,266
Let's start at the top.


627
00:19:52,346 --> 00:19:54,366
Across the top, we have three


628
00:19:54,366 --> 00:19:55,336
headline numbers.


629
00:19:55,466 --> 00:19:56,496
These are the same numbers that


630
00:19:56,496 --> 00:19:57,976
we saw before in the shows


631
00:19:57,976 --> 00:19:58,316
table.


632
00:19:59,216 --> 00:20:00,666
But now we have a mini time


633
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,296
series underneath these numbers


634
00:20:02,426 --> 00:20:04,596
to give you a sense of how


635
00:20:04,596 --> 00:20:05,356
things are doing.


636
00:20:06,996 --> 00:20:08,516
Maybe you can see, just looking


637
00:20:08,516 --> 00:20:10,816
at that little line if your show


638
00:20:10,816 --> 00:20:13,496
is getting more or fewer


639
00:20:13,836 --> 00:20:14,936
listeners over time.


640
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:18,506
Now, let's look beneath this row


641
00:20:19,536 --> 00:20:21,486
and take a look at the chart on


642
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:22,246
the left here.


643
00:20:22,706 --> 00:20:24,006
This is the doughnut chart of


644
00:20:24,006 --> 00:20:24,946
total time listened.


645
00:20:27,736 --> 00:20:29,566
So, for all of the time spent


646
00:20:29,566 --> 00:20:31,606
listening to your show, were


647
00:20:32,456 --> 00:20:34,686
those devices subscribed or not


648
00:20:34,686 --> 00:20:35,256
subscribed?


649
00:20:35,736 --> 00:20:38,176
Here, we can see that 83% of


650
00:20:38,176 --> 00:20:40,436
that 328,000 total hours of


651
00:20:40,436 --> 00:20:41,616
listening was done by a


652
00:20:41,616 --> 00:20:44,306
subscribed device, versus 17%


653
00:20:44,306 --> 00:20:44,976
not subscribed.


654
00:20:45,366 --> 00:20:46,906
So, these are pretty good


655
00:20:46,906 --> 00:20:47,376
numbers.


656
00:20:48,186 --> 00:20:49,776
But why might these numbers be


657
00:20:49,776 --> 00:20:50,776
different when you take a look


658
00:20:50,776 --> 00:20:51,726
at your data?


659
00:20:52,556 --> 00:20:55,126
Well, if you have a very small


660
00:20:55,126 --> 00:20:56,806
podcast, one with a very


661
00:20:56,946 --> 00:20:58,156
dedicated following.


662
00:20:59,016 --> 00:21:00,766
You might not have too many new


663
00:21:00,766 --> 00:21:03,056
listeners, but your subscribed


664
00:21:03,056 --> 00:21:05,086
count might be above 90 even


665
00:21:05,086 --> 00:21:05,966
95%.


666
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:09,206
Conversely, if you're doing a


667
00:21:09,206 --> 00:21:10,696
lot of marketing or promotion,


668
00:21:11,046 --> 00:21:13,706
or your show is growing rapidly


669
00:21:14,876 --> 00:21:16,106
you're not subscribed count


670
00:21:16,486 --> 00:21:18,236
might be fairly high.


671
00:21:19,996 --> 00:21:21,406
Now, when somebody first starts


672
00:21:21,406 --> 00:21:22,516
to listen to your show,


673
00:21:22,786 --> 00:21:23,746
obviously they're not going to


674
00:21:23,746 --> 00:21:25,316
be subscribed most of the time.


675
00:21:25,316 --> 00:21:26,746
But once they hear what you


676
00:21:26,746 --> 00:21:28,126
have, and they hit that


677
00:21:28,126 --> 00:21:30,066
subscribe button, that's when


678
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:36,226
they end up in the other bucket.


679
00:21:36,226 --> 00:21:37,226
Oh. Now, let's take a look at


680
00:21:37,226 --> 00:21:38,416
the chart to the right.


681
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:39,636
This is the top countries by


682
00:21:39,636 --> 00:21:40,126
device.


683
00:21:40,266 --> 00:21:41,446
Here we can see the top five


684
00:21:41,446 --> 00:21:42,446
countries for the show.


685
00:21:43,246 --> 00:21:44,636
As we can see, the United States


686
00:21:44,796 --> 00:21:46,136
comprises the majority of the


687
00:21:46,136 --> 00:21:47,996
listening at 78%.


688
00:21:48,786 --> 00:21:50,596
But what's neat about this is


689
00:21:50,596 --> 00:21:52,306
that if we look at the fifth


690
00:21:52,306 --> 00:21:53,696
spot, we see Brazil.


691
00:21:53,696 --> 00:21:55,736
Now, what's neat about this is


692
00:21:55,736 --> 00:21:57,176
that Brazil wasn't on this top


693
00:21:57,176 --> 00:21:58,126
five before.


694
00:21:58,886 --> 00:22:01,396
But, as Anne said earlier, this


695
00:22:01,396 --> 00:22:02,866
is season two of "The Very


696
00:22:02,866 --> 00:22:04,156
Hungry Tourists" and on the


697
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:05,676
first episode of this season,


698
00:22:05,876 --> 00:22:06,636
they actually went down to


699
00:22:06,636 --> 00:22:07,236
Brazil.


700
00:22:07,776 --> 00:22:08,946
They did some marketing and


701
00:22:08,946 --> 00:22:10,756
promotion, and it's starting to


702
00:22:10,756 --> 00:22:10,976
pay off.


703
00:22:13,516 --> 00:22:15,526
So, next, let's scroll down to


704
00:22:15,526 --> 00:22:16,556
the bottom of the page.


705
00:22:17,306 --> 00:22:19,396
And here we can see the 10 most


706
00:22:19,396 --> 00:22:21,076
recently released episodes for


707
00:22:21,076 --> 00:22:21,686
the show.


708
00:22:22,266 --> 00:22:24,266
This is the same sort of data


709
00:22:24,266 --> 00:22:25,466
table that we saw before for


710
00:22:25,466 --> 00:22:27,246
episodes, but this time it's for


711
00:22:27,396 --> 00:22:28,156
a single show.


712
00:22:28,526 --> 00:22:29,946
What's nice about this is we can


713
00:22:29,946 --> 00:22:31,816
compare apples to apples and


714
00:22:31,816 --> 00:22:33,156
really see on an


715
00:22:33,246 --> 00:22:35,356
episode-by-episode basis how


716
00:22:35,356 --> 00:22:37,896
things are turning out.


717
00:22:38,186 --> 00:22:39,936
Let's go back up to the top, and


718
00:22:40,966 --> 00:22:42,176
we're going to switch from the


719
00:22:43,516 --> 00:22:45,876
show overview tab to the trends


720
00:22:45,876 --> 00:22:46,176
tab.


721
00:22:47,056 --> 00:22:48,896
So, here we are in the trends


722
00:22:48,896 --> 00:22:49,166
tab.


723
00:22:50,506 --> 00:22:52,456
This is a time series chart,


724
00:22:52,556 --> 00:22:55,006
where we can see day by day how


725
00:22:55,006 --> 00:22:56,246
many people are turning into the


726
00:22:56,246 --> 00:22:56,706
show.


727
00:22:56,846 --> 00:22:58,916
And again, by default, we're


728
00:22:58,916 --> 00:23:00,736
looking at the last 60 days of


729
00:23:00,736 --> 00:23:01,046
data.


730
00:23:01,816 --> 00:23:03,846
In the top left corner, we see


731
00:23:03,846 --> 00:23:05,456
that headline number again of


732
00:23:05,496 --> 00:23:07,796
256,000 unique devices.


733
00:23:08,666 --> 00:23:10,116
And down below the time series


734
00:23:10,116 --> 00:23:12,536
chart, we see a table with


735
00:23:12,536 --> 00:23:13,516
episode titles.


736
00:23:13,626 --> 00:23:15,046
We can choose up to five


737
00:23:15,216 --> 00:23:16,636
separate episodes to compare


738
00:23:16,636 --> 00:23:18,006
against one another in the chart


739
00:23:18,006 --> 00:23:18,316
above.


740
00:23:21,136 --> 00:23:23,686
So, let's first now, talk about


741
00:23:23,816 --> 00:23:26,156
all of the different dropdowns


742
00:23:26,426 --> 00:23:28,846
that control the chart and what


743
00:23:28,846 --> 00:23:29,656
we see in it.


744
00:23:30,456 --> 00:23:32,296
First up, we have a dropdown,


745
00:23:32,436 --> 00:23:33,876
this is the metric that we're


746
00:23:33,876 --> 00:23:34,576
going to chart.


747
00:23:34,906 --> 00:23:36,086
By default we start off with


748
00:23:36,086 --> 00:23:38,156
unique devices, or you can also


749
00:23:38,156 --> 00:23:40,246
choose to have it render total


750
00:23:40,246 --> 00:23:40,836
time listened.


751
00:23:41,506 --> 00:23:44,406
To the right of that, we have


752
00:23:44,406 --> 00:23:46,096
another dropdown, this is what I


753
00:23:46,096 --> 00:23:47,316
call the primary filter.


754
00:23:48,546 --> 00:23:49,716
By default, here we're looking


755
00:23:49,716 --> 00:23:51,896
at episode as the primary


756
00:23:51,896 --> 00:23:52,316
filter.


757
00:23:52,516 --> 00:23:53,736
But you might want to choose


758
00:23:53,866 --> 00:23:55,546
country or subscribed device.


759
00:23:55,916 --> 00:23:57,236
Now, whatever you choose for


760
00:23:57,236 --> 00:23:58,806
your primary filter that's going


761
00:23:58,806 --> 00:24:00,286
to dictate the table beneath the


762
00:24:00,286 --> 00:24:00,636
chart.


763
00:24:01,486 --> 00:24:02,936
So, whatever is selected allows


764
00:24:02,936 --> 00:24:04,716
you to choose multiple entries


765
00:24:04,716 --> 00:24:05,936
to compare against one another.


766
00:24:06,546 --> 00:24:08,056
For example, we could choose


767
00:24:08,216 --> 00:24:10,496
country and we'll have countries


768
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:11,456
in that table below.


769
00:24:12,246 --> 00:24:13,566
Whatever filters are not


770
00:24:13,566 --> 00:24:15,726
selected from this menu, they


771
00:24:15,726 --> 00:24:17,486
move over to the righthand side


772
00:24:17,486 --> 00:24:18,386
of the page in their own


773
00:24:18,386 --> 00:24:19,076
dropdowns.


774
00:24:20,266 --> 00:24:22,856
For example, countries or


775
00:24:23,316 --> 00:24:24,256
subscription state.


776
00:24:24,936 --> 00:24:26,226
For each of these, you can


777
00:24:26,226 --> 00:24:28,446
choose up to one filter.


778
00:24:29,706 --> 00:24:31,936
Now with that, that's enough


779
00:24:31,936 --> 00:24:33,726
talking through slides.


780
00:24:33,726 --> 00:24:35,426
Let's look at a demo and I will


781
00:24:35,426 --> 00:24:38,966
take you back to that page, but


782
00:24:39,606 --> 00:24:41,056
in a hands-on fashion.


783
00:24:42,426 --> 00:24:43,926
So, here we are.


784
00:24:44,236 --> 00:24:45,216
We're on that same view that we


785
00:24:45,216 --> 00:24:47,156
saw before of the trends page.


786
00:24:48,506 --> 00:24:50,606
But now, we can see what happens


787
00:24:50,606 --> 00:24:52,396
when I interact with it.


788
00:24:52,676 --> 00:24:54,096
When I move my mouse cursor over


789
00:24:54,096 --> 00:24:56,536
the chart, we have this nice


790
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:58,526
data legend with details about


791
00:24:58,526 --> 00:24:59,936
the specific point that I'm


792
00:24:59,936 --> 00:25:00,556
hovering over.


793
00:25:01,176 --> 00:25:02,366
In this case I'm looking at May


794
00:25:02,366 --> 00:25:06,016
18th, where 34,000 unique


795
00:25:06,016 --> 00:25:07,656
devices tuned in.


796
00:25:08,876 --> 00:25:10,366
I can go down the page.


797
00:25:10,776 --> 00:25:12,006
I'm going to select a few


798
00:25:12,006 --> 00:25:14,626
episodes to chart against each


799
00:25:14,626 --> 00:25:14,956
other.


800
00:25:17,756 --> 00:25:19,616
You get this nice colorful view.


801
00:25:20,216 --> 00:25:22,226
And as I mouse over, I can also


802
00:25:22,226 --> 00:25:23,856
again see the details of what


803
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:24,586
I'm hovering over.


804
00:25:24,976 --> 00:25:26,306
In this case, I can see episode


805
00:25:26,306 --> 00:25:28,546
titles and their corresponding


806
00:25:28,546 --> 00:25:29,966
counts for those days.


807
00:25:30,566 --> 00:25:34,186
Now I'm going to go change my


808
00:25:34,186 --> 00:25:35,826
primary filter.


809
00:25:35,826 --> 00:25:36,896
And I'm going to switch it from


810
00:25:36,896 --> 00:25:37,956
episode to country.


811
00:25:38,686 --> 00:25:41,326
So, this updates the chart once


812
00:25:41,326 --> 00:25:41,716
again.


813
00:25:41,866 --> 00:25:43,266
This is the same actual graph


814
00:25:43,266 --> 00:25:44,276
that we saw the first time,


815
00:25:44,996 --> 00:25:46,076
because now again we're looking


816
00:25:46,076 --> 00:25:46,966
at all countries.


817
00:25:47,626 --> 00:25:49,546
but I'm going to choose the top


818
00:25:49,546 --> 00:25:53,026
five countries and compare those


819
00:25:53,026 --> 00:25:53,786
against each other.


820
00:25:55,376 --> 00:25:56,806
Once again, we get this colorful


821
00:25:56,806 --> 00:25:57,186
chart.


822
00:25:57,976 --> 00:25:59,416
But in this particular case,


823
00:25:59,846 --> 00:26:01,086
because the United States


824
00:26:01,086 --> 00:26:02,056
represents so much of the


825
00:26:02,056 --> 00:26:03,976
listening for this show, it


826
00:26:03,976 --> 00:26:05,476
makes it difficult to see the


827
00:26:05,476 --> 00:26:06,406
other countries and how they


828
00:26:06,406 --> 00:26:07,546
stack up against each other.


829
00:26:07,916 --> 00:26:09,276
So, I'm actually going to go and


830
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:10,786
deselect the United States.


831
00:26:11,316 --> 00:26:13,796
The chart adjusts, and we can


832
00:26:13,976 --> 00:26:16,586
really see with more detail how


833
00:26:16,586 --> 00:26:17,626
each country is doing.


834
00:26:18,216 --> 00:26:22,716
And now that I can, I'm going to


835
00:26:22,716 --> 00:26:25,506
show you the date picker, it's


836
00:26:25,506 --> 00:26:26,676
up here on the top right corner.


837
00:26:27,066 --> 00:26:28,356
By default it's set to the last


838
00:26:28,356 --> 00:26:29,096
60 days.


839
00:26:29,326 --> 00:26:31,706
You can switch that to weeks, or


840
00:26:31,936 --> 00:26:32,886
a specific month.


841
00:26:33,416 --> 00:26:34,796
But we'll leave it at that for


842
00:26:34,796 --> 00:26:35,046
now.


843
00:26:35,906 --> 00:26:36,926
Now, there are lots of


844
00:26:37,126 --> 00:26:38,486
combinations that you can make


845
00:26:38,486 --> 00:26:38,716
here.


846
00:26:39,466 --> 00:26:42,096
but I'm going to move on after


847
00:26:42,096 --> 00:26:42,376
this.


848
00:26:42,376 --> 00:26:43,816
But I really encourage you to


849
00:26:43,816 --> 00:26:45,036
take a look at your shows and


850
00:26:45,036 --> 00:26:46,856
see how they're doing and really


851
00:26:46,856 --> 00:26:47,786
play around with this tool.


852
00:26:47,786 --> 00:26:49,076
I think it's a lot of fun to


853
00:26:49,076 --> 00:26:49,456
use.


854
00:26:49,846 --> 00:26:51,106
So, let's switch over to the


855
00:26:51,106 --> 00:26:52,686
show episodes tab.


856
00:26:53,276 --> 00:26:54,526
And in this view, we can see the


857
00:26:54,526 --> 00:26:56,426
top episodes, or the all


858
00:26:56,426 --> 00:26:58,106
episodes for this show, not just


859
00:26:58,106 --> 00:26:59,076
the top episodes.


860
00:26:59,716 --> 00:27:01,586
In this case, this show has 11


861
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:03,086
episodes total.


862
00:27:03,836 --> 00:27:05,446
And now, because all episodes


863
00:27:05,446 --> 00:27:07,186
are together in this view, we


864
00:27:07,186 --> 00:27:08,406
have the opportunity now to


865
00:27:08,406 --> 00:27:09,986
answer some other questions like


866
00:27:10,776 --> 00:27:11,666
what are the most popular


867
00:27:11,666 --> 00:27:12,396
episodes.


868
00:27:13,096 --> 00:27:14,396
One way to answer that is by


869
00:27:15,076 --> 00:27:17,026
sorting by the unique devices


870
00:27:17,066 --> 00:27:17,436
column.


871
00:27:18,336 --> 00:27:19,946
When I do that, I can see that


872
00:27:20,606 --> 00:27:22,376
essentially season 1, episode 4,


873
00:27:22,376 --> 00:27:22,896
"Barcelona.


874
00:27:22,896 --> 00:27:24,176
Barbacoa that is the most


875
00:27:24,176 --> 00:27:27,336
popular by unique devices.


876
00:27:27,716 --> 00:27:29,206
But maybe you think that it's


877
00:27:29,206 --> 00:27:30,436
actually total time listened


878
00:27:31,056 --> 00:27:33,306
that should be the determinant


879
00:27:33,306 --> 00:27:34,126
of popularity.


880
00:27:34,126 --> 00:27:36,136
So, I'm going to sort by that


881
00:27:36,136 --> 00:27:36,706
instead.


882
00:27:36,706 --> 00:27:37,906
And we see that it's actually


883
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:40,256
season 2, episode 1 that takes


884
00:27:40,256 --> 00:27:41,636
the top spot.


885
00:27:41,636 --> 00:27:43,236
Or, for myself, I personally


886
00:27:43,236 --> 00:27:44,556
really like average consumption.


887
00:27:45,226 --> 00:27:46,386
So, I'm going to sort by that,


888
00:27:46,386 --> 00:27:49,216
and I can see that at 89% the


889
00:27:49,216 --> 00:27:50,366
trailer is actually the most


890
00:27:50,366 --> 00:27:52,416
popular episode, which makes


891
00:27:52,416 --> 00:27:53,486
sense because it's a short


892
00:27:53,486 --> 00:27:53,976
episode.


893
00:27:56,856 --> 00:27:58,606
So, now, we've actually seen all


894
00:27:58,606 --> 00:28:00,826
of the show level views, now I'd


895
00:28:00,826 --> 00:28:02,766
like to take you into an episode


896
00:28:02,956 --> 00:28:03,646
level view.


897
00:28:03,806 --> 00:28:05,326
So, I'm going to click through


898
00:28:05,326 --> 00:28:07,856
on the title for the most


899
00:28:07,856 --> 00:28:09,206
recently released episode.


900
00:28:10,196 --> 00:28:12,566
Here's "Broken Heirloom" this


901
00:28:12,566 --> 00:28:14,696
was just released on June 1st.


902
00:28:15,696 --> 00:28:16,656
Front and center we see a


903
00:28:16,656 --> 00:28:17,646
timeline chart.


904
00:28:18,186 --> 00:28:19,886
This shows you the audience size


905
00:28:20,526 --> 00:28:21,806
over the duration of the


906
00:28:21,806 --> 00:28:22,386
episode.


907
00:28:22,386 --> 00:28:24,006
Actually at every 5 seconds.


908
00:28:24,756 --> 00:28:25,806
And when I hoover over the


909
00:28:25,806 --> 00:28:27,506
chart, I can see a data legend


910
00:28:27,506 --> 00:28:29,056
again with details about the


911
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:30,806
specific time in the episode,


912
00:28:31,026 --> 00:28:31,936
it's total count and its


913
00:28:31,936 --> 00:28:34,426
percentage of the max.


914
00:28:35,446 --> 00:28:37,096
And in the top left corner, we


915
00:28:37,096 --> 00:28:39,276
see this headline number for the


916
00:28:39,276 --> 00:28:40,736
total number of unique devices.


917
00:28:41,686 --> 00:28:42,886
Something to note about this


918
00:28:42,886 --> 00:28:44,086
chart, unlike all the other


919
00:28:44,086 --> 00:28:46,946
views in Podcast Analytics, this


920
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:49,696
chart is actually for all time.


921
00:28:49,696 --> 00:28:52,436
Not just a specified date range.


922
00:28:54,496 --> 00:28:56,416
Now, what's really nice to see


923
00:28:56,416 --> 00:28:59,086
here is that in this case, most


924
00:28:59,086 --> 00:29:00,176
of the people who started this


925
00:29:00,176 --> 00:29:01,726
episode actually hung out for


926
00:29:01,726 --> 00:29:02,906
the entire duration.


927
00:29:03,426 --> 00:29:04,656
This is a really healthy-looking


928
00:29:04,656 --> 00:29:05,146
episode.


929
00:29:06,116 --> 00:29:08,666
Now, beneath the chart, if I


930
00:29:08,666 --> 00:29:10,016
scroll down a little bit we can


931
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:13,416
see for the last 60 days the


932
00:29:13,416 --> 00:29:15,516
metrics for this show, for this


933
00:29:15,516 --> 00:29:16,676
episode, I should say.


934
00:29:17,566 --> 00:29:19,586
This gives you a more recent


935
00:29:19,906 --> 00:29:21,326
sense of how this episode is


936
00:29:21,326 --> 00:29:22,716
doing, not just all-time.


937
00:29:23,236 --> 00:29:24,416
And at the very bottom, we see


938
00:29:24,416 --> 00:29:25,836
the top 10 countries for this


939
00:29:25,836 --> 00:29:26,296
episode.


940
00:29:27,236 --> 00:29:28,746
But I'm going to scroll back up


941
00:29:28,746 --> 00:29:31,266
and cover two things that I


942
00:29:31,476 --> 00:29:32,696
breezed past before.


943
00:29:33,566 --> 00:29:35,526
There is a dropdown menu above


944
00:29:35,526 --> 00:29:37,376
that all-time devices number.


945
00:29:38,116 --> 00:29:39,876
And when I click on this I can


946
00:29:39,876 --> 00:29:41,436
see that I can also choose


947
00:29:41,586 --> 00:29:43,166
devices or total time listened.


948
00:29:44,166 --> 00:29:45,736
Now by choosing either of those,


949
00:29:45,736 --> 00:29:47,016
it will actually take us into a


950
00:29:47,016 --> 00:29:49,596
view which is a timeseries view


951
00:29:49,826 --> 00:29:51,546
just like the show trends page.


952
00:29:51,866 --> 00:29:53,306
Except this time, it's tied


953
00:29:53,306 --> 00:29:57,966
specifically to this episode.


954
00:29:58,186 --> 00:30:00,896
And now, the part of this graph


955
00:30:00,896 --> 00:30:02,866
that I like the best is actually


956
00:30:02,866 --> 00:30:04,126
the ability to playback the


957
00:30:04,126 --> 00:30:06,216
audio while seeing how the


958
00:30:06,216 --> 00:30:07,926
audience is reacting over the


959
00:30:07,926 --> 00:30:08,966
duration of the episode.


960
00:30:08,966 --> 00:30:11,696
And I can do this by going down


961
00:30:11,696 --> 00:30:12,706
to the bottom left corner of the


962
00:30:12,706 --> 00:30:14,276
graph and hitting this play


963
00:30:14,276 --> 00:30:14,646
button.


964
00:30:15,116 --> 00:30:16,016
>> [Background Music] Hey,


965
00:30:16,016 --> 00:30:17,446
there, hunger heads and welcome


966
00:30:17,446 --> 00:30:19,246
back to another episode of "The


967
00:30:19,246 --> 00:30:20,286
Very Hungry Tourists."


968
00:30:20,566 --> 00:30:21,736
I'm Maria Sanchez, PhD.


969
00:30:21,736 --> 00:30:23,246
>> And I'm Johnny Appleseed.


970
00:30:23,496 --> 00:30:25,146
>> In today's episode we headed


971
00:30:25,146 --> 00:30:26,466
to Brooklyn-based, Vinnie's


972
00:30:26,466 --> 00:30:26,936
Pizzeria.


973
00:30:27,276 --> 00:30:28,886
As you'll hear, even Johnny's


974
00:30:28,966 --> 00:30:30,786
massive blunder couldn't get in


975
00:30:30,786 --> 00:30:31,906
the way of our culinary


976
00:30:31,906 --> 00:30:32,286
adventure.


977
00:30:32,466 --> 00:30:33,466
>> I'm still blushing from that


978
00:30:33,466 --> 00:30:33,646
one.


979
00:30:33,646 --> 00:30:35,866
>> So, this is actually a very


980
00:30:35,866 --> 00:30:37,546
entertaining episode, so if you


981
00:30:37,546 --> 00:30:38,276
get a chance you should


982
00:30:38,276 --> 00:30:39,176
definitely check it out.


983
00:30:40,846 --> 00:30:43,966
But like any basic player, you


984
00:30:43,966 --> 00:30:44,986
don't just have to start at the


985
00:30:44,986 --> 00:30:45,396
beginning.


986
00:30:45,396 --> 00:30:46,296
You can also click on the


987
00:30:46,296 --> 00:30:47,946
timeline to jump ahead to any


988
00:30:47,946 --> 00:30:49,326
specific spot in time.


989
00:30:49,926 --> 00:30:51,636
And if you want to fine tune,


990
00:30:51,836 --> 00:30:53,046
you can grab the play head and


991
00:30:53,096 --> 00:30:53,536
scrub around.


992
00:30:53,656 --> 00:30:55,986
So, I'm actually going to scrub


993
00:30:55,986 --> 00:30:57,366
to the beginning of what looks


994
00:30:57,366 --> 00:30:58,076
like an ad.


995
00:30:58,876 --> 00:31:00,576
And so, just to validate my


996
00:31:00,576 --> 00:31:01,906
assumptions, I'm going to move


997
00:31:01,906 --> 00:31:03,586
to just before and take a


998
00:31:03,586 --> 00:31:04,056
listen.


999
00:31:04,446 --> 00:31:04,906
>> Five years.


1000
00:31:04,906 --> 00:31:05,716
You wouldn't believe it, but in


1001
00:31:05,716 --> 00:31:07,206
the back there's a big.


1002
00:31:07,206 --> 00:31:08,996
>> As the pizza goes in the


1003
00:31:08,996 --> 00:31:10,736
over, let's take a moment to


1004
00:31:10,736 --> 00:31:11,996
hear about our great sponsors.


1005
00:31:12,606 --> 00:31:13,036
>> [Background Music] So, your


1006
00:31:13,036 --> 00:31:14,366
hands and face are smothered


1007
00:31:14,366 --> 00:31:15,736
with tahini sauce, so what do


1008
00:31:15,736 --> 00:31:16,236
you do?


1009
00:31:16,236 --> 00:31:17,036
>> Get a paper towel?


1010
00:31:17,246 --> 00:31:17,746
>> Oh, too rough.


1011
00:31:17,926 --> 00:31:18,306
>> Tissue?


1012
00:31:18,306 --> 00:31:18,896
>> Too soft.


1013
00:31:18,896 --> 00:31:19,596
>> What about napkins?


1014
00:31:19,676 --> 00:31:21,186
>> That's a great idea.


1015
00:31:21,606 --> 00:31:23,276
>> Napkins to You is a new drone


1016
00:31:23,276 --> 00:31:24,586

1017
00:31:24,586 --> 00:31:26,336
napkins where and whenever you


1018
00:31:26,336 --> 00:31:26,756
need them.


1019
00:31:26,756 --> 00:31:28,256

1020
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:30,076
a drop-off and the closest drone


1021
00:31:30,076 --> 00:31:31,336
is deployed to your location.


1022
00:31:31,716 --> 00:31:32,366
[Background noise] By typing in


1023
00:31:32,366 --> 00:31:33,676
the promo code, hungry, you can


1024
00:31:33,676 --> 00:31:34,976
have your very own napkins


1025

delivered for just 4.99 per


1026
00:31:36,726 --> 00:31:37,036
month.


1027
00:31:37,366 --> 00:31:38,996
>> Again, that's Napkins to You.


1028
00:31:38,996 --> 00:31:42,136
>> So, that sounds like a really


1029
00:31:42,136 --> 00:31:43,376
entertaining ad, and it's too


1030
00:31:43,376 --> 00:31:45,016
bad that some people decided to


1031
00:31:45,016 --> 00:31:45,846
skip it.


1032
00:31:46,206 --> 00:31:48,526
But, if you actually do the math


1033
00:31:49,096 --> 00:31:51,886
from before the ad to the bottom


1034
00:31:51,886 --> 00:31:54,156
of the ad, it's only about a 14%


1035
00:31:54,156 --> 00:31:54,526
drop.


1036
00:31:54,526 --> 00:31:55,226
And it seems like it's a


1037
00:31:55,226 --> 00:31:56,026
temporary drop.


1038
00:31:56,026 --> 00:31:56,876
So, it's doing pretty well.


1039
00:32:00,816 --> 00:32:01,496
So, with that,


1040
00:32:04,406 --> 00:32:06,786
I want to switch back to a slide


1041
00:32:06,786 --> 00:32:08,696
and I just want to say, that


1042
00:32:08,696 --> 00:32:10,336
wraps up the walk-through and


1043
00:32:10,336 --> 00:32:12,196
demo of Podcast Analytics for


1044
00:32:12,196 --> 00:32:12,286
you.


1045
00:32:13,436 --> 00:32:14,816
And I hope that you were able to


1046
00:32:14,816 --> 00:32:16,096
learn some things about how this


1047
00:32:16,096 --> 00:32:17,796
tool works and maybe how it can


1048
00:32:17,796 --> 00:32:19,166
help you better understand your


1049
00:32:19,166 --> 00:32:19,756
audience.


1050
00:32:20,836 --> 00:32:22,226
And Podcast Analytics is in


1051
00:32:22,226 --> 00:32:22,546
beta.


1052
00:32:23,136 --> 00:32:24,506
And we are very interested in


1053
00:32:24,506 --> 00:32:25,166
your feedback.


1054
00:32:25,796 --> 00:32:28,446

1058
00:32:32,816 --> 00:32:35,056
what you think about Podcast


1059
00:32:35,056 --> 00:32:37,066
Analytics and give us your


1060
00:32:37,066 --> 00:32:37,526
feedback.


1061
00:32:38,226 --> 00:32:38,566
Thank you.


1062
00:32:39,296 --> 00:32:40,406
Now, let's bring it back to


1063

1066
00:32:51,186 --> 00:32:51,786
awesome.


1067
00:32:52,046 --> 00:32:53,086
So, that's a walk-through of


1068
00:32:53,086 --> 00:32:54,986
Podcast Analytics, which again,


1069
00:32:55,456 --> 00:32:57,346
is available to anyone with a


1070
00:32:57,346 --> 00:32:58,836
podcast in our catalog.


1071
00:32:58,836 --> 00:33:01,396
If you haven't used it, try it


1072
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:01,616
out.


1073
00:33:01,946 --> 00:33:03,476
We'll also be at a lab


1074
00:33:03,476 --> 00:33:04,576
immediately following this


1075
00:33:04,576 --> 00:33:07,606
session, so come find us.


1076
00:33:07,646 --> 00:33:09,356
And that's where we are today,


1077
00:33:09,356 --> 00:33:10,856
but really we've just begun.


1078
00:33:11,266 --> 00:33:12,666
You guys are the reason that we


1079
00:33:12,666 --> 00:33:13,246
did this.


1080
00:33:13,246 --> 00:33:14,926
And we love hearing from you.


1081
00:33:15,856 --> 00:33:16,916
So, keep it coming.


1082
00:33:17,376 --> 00:33:19,096
For example, we know that many


1083
00:33:19,096 --> 00:33:20,966
of you want an API, or


1084
00:33:20,966 --> 00:33:22,486
subscription and download data


1085
00:33:22,486 --> 00:33:24,526
or geographic demographics with


1086
00:33:24,846 --> 00:33:26,316
more specificity.


1087
00:33:26,316 --> 00:33:27,706
We love the suggestions.


1088
00:33:27,996 --> 00:33:29,886
We hear you, and we're working


1089
00:33:29,886 --> 00:33:30,956
on improving the product in the


1090
00:33:30,956 --> 00:33:31,346
future.


1091
00:33:31,916 --> 00:33:34,526
We are also going to be asking


1092
00:33:34,526 --> 00:33:36,826
for some things from you in the


1093
00:33:36,826 --> 00:33:38,836
future, including new


1094
00:33:38,836 --> 00:33:41,086
specifications around HTTPS,


1095
00:33:41,866 --> 00:33:45,706
pubDates, consistent GUIDs and


1096
00:33:45,706 --> 00:33:48,226
cover art that meets a minimum


1097
00:33:48,656 --> 00:33:50,226
required resolution.


1098
00:33:50,866 --> 00:33:52,276
So, for continued access to


1099
00:33:52,276 --> 00:33:53,326
analytics in the future, you


1100
00:33:53,326 --> 00:33:54,926
will absolutely need to have


1101
00:33:55,276 --> 00:33:56,276
those four things.


1102
00:33:57,626 --> 00:33:59,076
We're also going to be releasing


1103
00:33:59,076 --> 00:34:00,916
some guidelines around best


1104
00:34:00,916 --> 00:34:02,736
practices for audio mastering,


1105
00:34:02,966 --> 00:34:03,966
to give you a sense of the


1106
00:34:03,966 --> 00:34:05,676
ranges you should be using so


1107
00:34:05,676 --> 00:34:07,236
that your podcast sounds the


1108
00:34:07,236 --> 00:34:10,226
best it can on HomePod and


1109
00:34:10,226 --> 00:34:11,516
within the context of Apple

1111
00:34:13,226 --> 00:34:14,406
We'll be sharing these


1112
00:34:14,406 --> 00:34:15,815
requirements with you all.


1113
00:34:15,815 --> 00:34:17,246
We will put them in Podcast


1114
00:34:17,246 --> 00:34:18,956
Resources and Help so you can


1115
00:34:18,956 --> 00:34:20,835
refer back to them any time.


1116
00:34:22,025 --> 00:34:24,266
And speaking of which, last but


1117
00:34:24,266 --> 00:34:25,626
not least, I want to remind you


1118
00:34:25,626 --> 00:34:26,766
about our resources for


1119
00:34:26,766 --> 00:34:27,525

1120
00:34:28,696 --> 00:34:31,646
So, we have a Branding Guide for


1121
00:34:31,646 --> 00:34:32,576
podcasters.


1122
00:34:33,025 --> 00:34:35,005
We also have the Affiliate

1126
00:34:39,116 --> 00:34:40,536
from the top right corner of the

00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:42,226

1128
00:34:42,226 --> 00:34:44,676

00:34:46,815 --> 00:34:48,436
Some tutorial videos for


1132
00:34:48,436 --> 00:34:50,266
